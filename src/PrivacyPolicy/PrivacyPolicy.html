<span>12.1 Google AdWords and Conversion Tracking</span><br>
We place Google AdWords display advertisements and use Google conversion tracking for the purposes of personalized online ads based on interests and location.

Advertisements are displayed based on search requests on websites in the Google ad network.

When a user clicks on an ad, Google places a cookie on the user’s device. For more information on the cookie technology used, please see Google’s statements on website statistics and their data privacy policy.

With the use of this technology, Google, and we as their customer, receive the information that a user has clicked on an ad and was redirected to our websites. The information acquired this way is solely used for statistical analysis related to ad optimization. We do not receive any information that would allow us to personally identify a visitor. The statistics provided to us by Google include the total number of users who have clicked on one of our ads and, where applicable, whether they were redirected to a page on our website that has a conversation tag. These statistics allow us to track which search terms most often lead to our ads receiving clicks, and which ads lead to the user contacting us via the contact form.

If you do not want this, you can prevent the storage of the cookies required for this technology by, for example, using the settings in your browser or your App. Should you do so, your visit will not be incorporated into user statistics.

You also have the option to choose the types of Google ads or deactivate interest-based ads on Google through ad settings. Alternatively, you can deactivate third-party use of cookies by using the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out tool.
<br><br>
<span>12.2 Google Dynamic Remarketing</span><br>
We use the dynamic remarketing function of Google AdWords on our website. This technology allows us to place automatically generated ads oriented towards target groups after you visit our website. Ads are oriented towards products and services that you clicked on during your last visit to our website.

Google uses cookies to generate interest-based ads. In this process, Google typically stores information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. This information only serves the purpose of mapping the web browser to a specific device. It cannot be used to identify an individual.

If you do not want to receive user-based advertising from Google, you can disable the placement of ads by using Google’s ad settings.

For more information about how Google cookies are used, please refer to Google’s privacy statement.
<br><br>
<span>12.3 Facebook family Custom Audiences</span><br>
The product Facebook Custom Audiences (Facebook Inc. 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA, 94304) for Facebook and Instagramm is also used as part of usage-based online advertising. An irreversible and non-personally identifiable checksum (hash total) is essentially generated by your usage data, which can be transmitted to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. A Facebook cookie is set in this process. In doing so, information about your activities on the website (such as surfing behavior, subpages visited, etc.) is collected. Your IP address is stored and used for geographical modulation.
